# NFL Combine Analysis: Predictive Models for 40-Yard Dash Times and Athletic Performance Insights

## Executive Summary
This project provides an in-depth analysis of the NFL Combine data to predict 40-yard dash times, a crucial metric for assessing speed in football. Utilizing machine learning models, this analysis not only offers predictions but also delivers valuable insights into the athletic performance of various positions in the sport.

## Introduction
The NFL Combine is a significant event in the career of college football players. It serves as a platform for evaluation and showcases physical and mental skills. This project focuses on the 40-yard dash, a key measure of speed, using data from 2000 to 2023.

## Key Takeaways
- Cornerbacks are the fastest players, emphasizing speed in secondary positions.
- EDGE players showcase a balanced blend of speed and strength.
- Defensive tackles demonstrate notable strength, vital for run defense and pass-rushing.
- The Random Forest model emerged as the most effective for predicting 40-yard dash times.

## Methodology
The analysis is segmented into data loading and preprocessing, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the application of advanced machine learning models like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and RandomForestRegressor.

## Data
The project utilizes NFL Combine data from 2000 to 2023, including player performance metrics like speed, strength, agility, and BMI.

## Technologies Used
- Python and libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn
- Machine Learning: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, RandomForestRegressor
